Microphone input processing into PreprocStreamerOfflineTool
------------------------------------------------------------

Task#1: Record from DMIC
	- Build 'make' to generate 'narecord' utility
	- Copy 'narecord' to /root/ path in DUT and 'chmod 777 narecord'
	- Run: './narecord' to dmic stream captured file n.wav

Task#2: Input buffer to the library preprocstreamer.so & Link binaries
	- IntelSstPreProcProcess takes instance handle, input buffer descriptor,
		pointer to buffer for output sample
	- Copy the 'narecord' along with libIntelSSTPreprocStreamer.so library
		 to path & export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	- Running narecord now, will generate n.wav with dmic capture & pass
		stream to algorithm

Task#3: Receive the noise cancelled buffer and write them to a file
	- Copy the contents of output_buffer from IntelSstPreProcProcess to
		another .wav file
	- Running narecord now, should generate n.wav with dmic capture stream,
		pass stream to algorithm and dump output of algorithm to
		final noiseless output file - algo_output.wav
